# protoc-gen-go-xml-enums

A plugin for [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) that generates XML marshal receivers for enums generated from `.proto` files. It enables enums to be marshaled/unmarshaled from their string variants.

## Deprecated and replaced by https://github.com/mkmarek/protoc-gen-go-enums which supports also JSON.
